# Security Policy

## Encryption key

- If you are using encryption, keep your encryption key and salt key secure and do not share them with anyone. Store keys in environment variables or a dedicated secret management service (for example, a cloud key vault), never commit them to source control or plain-text configuration files, restrict access to trusted systems and personnel only, and rotate keys periodically according to your organization’s security policy.
