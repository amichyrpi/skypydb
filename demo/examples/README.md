## Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use Skypydb.

Both the examples file for Python and for TypeScript are provided.

## Note

The project is moving toward a backend-first Rust API architecture. Existing local-runtime examples remain usable during transition, but future examples will target the HTTP backend running on port `8000`.
