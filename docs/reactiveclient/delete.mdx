  <Step title="Delete data">
    assuming you already create a table and already add data to it we can now delete data from the table:

    ```python Python
    # Access your tables
    success_table = tables["success"]
    warning_table = tables["warning"]
    error_table = tables["error"]

    # delete data on the table assuming they are already data in the table.
    success_table.delete(
        component="AuthService",
        user_id="user123"
    )
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>
