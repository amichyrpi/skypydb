title: ReactiveClient Encryption (Deprecated)
description: "Encryption docs moved to backend deployment and security docs"

<Warning>
  `ReactiveClient` encryption flow is no longer part of the SDK surface.
</Warning>

Mesosphere SDKs now call the backend over HTTP. Use backend-level security controls (network, API keys, TLS, and storage encryption).
